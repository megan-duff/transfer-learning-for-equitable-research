File: *_ref_af_calc.sh
- Computes the allele frequencies for each 1000 Genomes reference ancestry group. 

File: *_sim_af_calc.sh
- Computes the allele frequencies for each simulated ancestry group (simulated via HAPGEN2).

File: *_train_af.sh
- Computes the allele frequencies computed solely on the training dataset for each simulated ancestry group. 
- This will be used to standardize genotypes for the neural network models.
